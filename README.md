# UFOs


## Overview of Project:

### Purpose of this analysis.

In this module, we utilized Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build an interactive webpage on UFO sightings. The webpage accepts inputs from users and display the outcome in a table. The results are filtered based on several inputs specified such as date, city, state, country and shape and the output shown using these criteria as well as the duration and comments on the UFO sightings.

## Results:
Index Page

The first page is the index page and it is the where user can re-initialize the page clicking on the navbar (UFO Sightings) at the very top. See figure 1 below.

Header and paragraph

The section with the title "The Truth is Out There" uses Jumbotron to give the section its bold and appealing outcome and it's followed by the paragraph of what Ufologists know about UFO sightings. See figures 2 and 3 below.

Filter by date

When a user input the desire date, this is dectected and the table by the left of the screen is updated to capture this input.
Filter by city

When the user enters the city, the table is updated accordingly after dectecting the input.
Filter by state

The third outcome that could reflect on the table is state when a state is given as input.
Filter by country

The table is updated accordingly as well when a desired country is entered as input.
Filter by shape

The table is updated to reflect when a shape is given. The available shapes include circle, light, triangle, among others,
Filter by all parameters

All filter parameters such as date, city, state, country and shape can be filtered simultaneously. See figure 4 below.

## Summary:

### Drawback of the webpage

The filtered inputs are based on the data.js file. This means users have to go through the file to know what inputs to enter and this is a challenge for the filtering process. Also, the page should be able to return "No results found" whenever the search inputs do not match the dictionary in the data.js file.

### Recommendations for further improvements

The use of "clear filter" button is one area for further improvements. The clear filter button can be located below the Filter table button.

The uses of drop-down options would solve the drawback identified above.
